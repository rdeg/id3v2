/*
Package id3v2 can be used to retrieve most of the ID3v2 tags of an MP3 file.

It currently offers the two functions ProcessAllTags and MakeFileName, as
well as a Verbosity indicator that can be used to tune the level of verbosity
of the package (and, hopefully, of the application that uses it too).
